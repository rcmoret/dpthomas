The New DP Thomas Project

Due to legacy problems (with models and markup, primarily), with my original DP Thomas Project I have decided to rebuild the project from scratch.

With the skills I gained from the original DP Thomas Project and the Weeblog NSS project, I am confident that I will be able to rapidly and cleanly.

Goals and Intentions
I want to turn a site that has been in the wild (dpthomas.org) into a more full featured application.
Features:
  * Members who act as admins with the ability to edit the content of the public site
  * Discussion board where members can post topics and replies about business
  * Member profiles with contact information and personal images
  * An email list database of interested non-members, which can be accessed/used by members
  * A resources section where members can upload content and link to external resources
  * An organizational calendar for business purposes
