        %p
          Several #{ link_to "research studies", "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/05/07/fat-forecast-42-of-americans-obese-by-2030", target: :new } forecast an additional 32+ million Americans will be classified as obese by 2030, bringing the total to an astounding 42% - 50% of the adult population. The DP Thomas Foundation for Obesity, founded in 2010 by Dolly Patton-Thomas, seeks to change the outlook reported by these researchers. The Foundation incorporates a series of workshops, seminars, counseling, and together strategies to help the community and its families formulate individualized lifestyle plans. These plans follow a methodology of natural and organic nutrition coupled with proper exercise and balanced living to create a lifestyle free from obesity. A healthy lifestyle was Dolly Patton-Thomas' goal for herself and she hopes to pass it on through the outreach of the DP Thomas Foundation for Obesity.
