The DP Thomas Foundation for Obesity, founded in 2010 by Dolly Patton-Thomas, seeks to change the outlook reported by these researchers. The Foundation incorporates a series of workshops, seminars, counseling, and together strategies to help the community and its families formulate individualized lifestyle plans. These plans follow a methodology of natural and organic nutrition coupled with proper exercise and balanced living to create a lifestyle free from obesity. A healthy lifestyle was Dolly Patton-Thomas' goal for herself and she hopes to pass it on through the outreach of the DP Thomas Foundation for Obesity. <h2>Board Members</h2>")
